# LOTTO

This very basic NodeJS application allows you to calculate random arrays of winning lotto numbers as well as the customers chosen numbers. With this we can print out a if they're a winner, a table with the prizes and stats on the chances of winning the lotto.

All variables should be changed in the variables.js file and there should be no need to alter index.js unless you want to change the wording of a string.
